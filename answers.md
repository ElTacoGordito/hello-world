Q: In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for best computing?

A: Through the use of branches, GitHub encourages marginal changes to data that are explained with descriptions,
making the editing process much easier to follow and repeat. The encouragement of making your code open-access also
facilitates means that your code still may repeat yourself, but it doesn't have to repeat others; this makes it
much easier to access modularized data. And of course, so much open-access data means that there will be a lot more 
collaboration, which is good for everybody. Because when the team wins, everybody wins.
